To be able to: 1- acknowledge/recognize the other person's reach-out, 2- be able to articulate the limits/boundaries of our abilities. </li><li>To be able to know what we know, and  is irresponsible to pretend to know beyond your actual abilities. It is ok if possible to:<br class="atl-forced-newline"/><ul><li>provide a space for it to take place, so the person can debrief.</li><li>be comfortable with NOT providing the solution.</li></ul></li><li>Go back to adult learning principles. Adults will learn and capture what is most useful to them at the moment (they won't take in more than they are 'able/willing/ready' to). </li><li>Sometimes it is important to take a step back when the organizational level trauma is a clear impediment to any reasonable chance at success.</li><li>Self-care:<br class="atl-forced-newline"/><ul><li>food/rest/exercise</li><li>have the emotional support group as well as the tech-support</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>When there are people who are actively "sabotaging" your work / training (i.e., IT person saying no to everything), make allies out of them from the start. Same with staff who are resistant to change / learning. </li><li> Recognise that sometimes you will need to compromise on the strictness of the security standard in order to convince people about the larger goal. </li></ul><h1>How to talk about risk without creating too much fear</h1><ul><li>warn them that now we will demistify and in the process fear will come - get consence - point that ways to mitigate will come after the 'scary' part</li><li>always have time to provide the mitigation in the same time-space where you 'scare' people</li><li>there are situation that require clear demostration of extreme risks, eg. in organization situations where the leadership is endagering the constiuents through forcing them into insecure behavior.</li></ul><h1>Resources related to well-being, stress management</h1><ul><li><p class="page__title">Frontline Defenders: Resources for Wellbeing &amp; Stress Management: <a href="https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/resources-wellbeing-stress-management">https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/resources-wellbeing-stress-management</a></p></li><li>People: Sandra Ljubinkovic, Jelena Djordjevic, Adriana Dergam, Angela Kuga Thas,  Jane Barry</li><li>Holistic Security Manual: <a href="https://holistic-security.tacticaltech.org/">https://holistic-security.tacticaltech.org/</a></li><li>Capacitar Emergency Response Kits:<ul><li><a href="https://capacitar.org/product-category/manuals/">https://capacitar.org/product-category/manuals/</a></li><li><a href="https://capacitar.org/product-category/downloadable-digital-files/">https://capacitar.org/product-category/downloadable-digital-files/</a></li><li><span>Trauma Healing and Transformation</span> - <a href="https://capacitar.org/wp-content/uploads/Trauma-Healing-and-Transformation.pdf">https://capacitar.org/wp-content/uploads/Trauma-Healing-and-Transformation.pdf</a></li></ul></li><li>Safe Programme: <a href="https://www.irex.org/projects/safe"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,238);"> </span></a><a class="external-link" href="https://www.irex.org/projects/safe+" rel="nofollow">https://www.irex.org/projects/safe</a></li></ul><p><br/></p></div>
